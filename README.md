Overview
This project focuses on building and training a machine learning model that can distinguish between advertisements and non-advertisement images. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model can be used for various applications, such as filtering advertisement images from non-advertisement content.

The Challenge
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify images into advertisements or non-advertisements. The challenge involves:

Training the model using labeled data (advertisements vs. non-advertisements).
Fine-tuning the model to optimize performance and accuracy.
Deploying the solution for real-time use in detecting ad content in images.
Features
Advertisement Detection: Classifies whether an image is an advertisement or not.
Pre-trained Model: A trained model that can be used immediately to predict new images.
Customizable: Can be further trained or tuned with new datasets to improve accuracy.
Notebook Implementation: Jupyter notebook (ad-creatives.ipynb) for easy understanding and modification.

Usage
Model Training: The Jupyter notebook walks through the steps to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Model Prediction: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict whether a given image is an advertisement.
Future Improvements
Add more complex image augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Incorporate more advanced architectures (e.g., transfer learning using pre-trained models).
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time image classification.
